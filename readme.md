#RandomWords
RandomWords is a very simple [KeePass](http://keepass.info/) 2.x plugin that consists of a password generator that selects 4 random words from
 a list of common words and concatenates them into a password.

The word list included is a modified version of the *3esl* list from SCOWL's [12 Dicts](http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/),
 a compilation of common english words.  Acronyms, abbreviations, contractions, hyphenated words, multiple word phrases, and words under three letters long have been removed.

Inspired by this [xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/936/)

###TODO###
- Implement Options (ex: number of words to select, delimiters, capitalize words, etc.)
- User supplied word list
